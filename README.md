## About Me

I am John Fregeau, an IT Support Specialist and Cybersecurity Enthusiast transitioning into the tech industry with a diverse background and a passion for technology. My journey began as an ESL teacher, where I honed my communication skills by teaching students worldwide through various online platforms. My experience grading algebra tests for Pearson high school students reflects my solid foundation in math and education, while my role as a behavioral aide equipped me with patience and the ability to work effectively with diverse individuals—a crucial skill in tech.

I also bring valuable customer service experience from my time as a security officer, where I developed strong interpersonal skills by interacting with customers at different levels. My academic journey, which includes an A.S. in Math and Science and a B.S. in Biology, has provided me with a strong scientific base for my current pursuit of an M.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. I am actively working towards completing my CompTIA A+ certification following a rigorous 6-month program with Climb Hire, and I have earned certificates in IT Specialist, Digital Marketing, Ethical Hacking, and Web Responsive Design from Coursera.

I am eager to bring this multifaceted skill set into the tech industry, where I can leverage my background in education, problem-solving, and cybersecurity to innovate and make a meaningful impact. My goal is to contribute effectively by blending my technical expertise with my passion for technology and continuous learning.
